            My name is Sasha, I am 22 years old and currently completing my second schoolyear at WISS Altstetten. 
            Before settling on developer, I tried out a couple of different career paths. I went to Atelierschule ZÃ¼rich (Rudolf Steiner Schule) for two years, got my advanced Diploma (Cambridge Certificate in Advanced English) during a language stay in London and I started an Apprenticeship as a Landscaping Gardener. As you can probably tell, neither High School nor the Gardener Apprenticeship was for me. After a Hiatus and a lot of contemplating I finally decided that I wanted to be a fullstack developer. I enrolled at WISS and started my developer journey. In the almost two years I have spent at this school, I have gathered all the skills necessary to be a useful asset to your team, having learned about different programming languages, databases, and different project management styles among other things. 
            In my free time I enjoy creative activities such as drawing and making music. I also like to work out and go skateboarding.
            </p>

            If you have any further questions, feedback, or would like to talk about the Internship, feel free to send me a message via the contact options listed below. I look forward to hearing from you.
            </p>

            In the PDF you will find my CV, my grade sheet, my advanced diploma, my multicheck and the PDF explaining the internship in more detail.

            At WISS Tests that haven't been written or graded yet, get written down as a "1".
